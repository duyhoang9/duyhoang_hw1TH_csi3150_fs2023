    <p> Hello, my name is Duy Hoang. I am a senior studying computer science and currently have a job at Bosch as a software developer. 
        I have a lot of expereience creating web pages and hosting servers, which is what I do at work. Along with debugging code in Python
        and joining a ton of meetings. I really do not like computers, hardware and software, I just went into computer science because it 
        rapidly growing and has a good work life balance. If you want to know more about my life, I suggest you check out <a href="html\my_resume.html">Resume</a> 
        and <a href="html\my_fun_facts.html">Fun Facts</a>.</p>
