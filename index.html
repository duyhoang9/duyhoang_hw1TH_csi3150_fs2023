      Hello, my name is Duy Hoang. I am a senior studying computer science and
      currently have a job at Bosch as a software developer. I have a lot of
      expereience creating web pages and hosting servers, which is what I do at
      work. Along with debugging code in Python and joining a ton of meetings. I
      really do not like computers, hardware and software, I just went into
      computer science because it rapidly growing and has a good work life
      balance. If you want to know more about my life, I suggest you check out
